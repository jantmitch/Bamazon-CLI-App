# Bamazon-CLI-App
Amazon-like storefront for buyers and sellers


This application works in node.js. It is similar to siri, but instead of being a speech-based application, it is language-based. It operates with Twitter, Spotify, and OMDB movie API's. Liri will return information based on user input after specific commands. 

# Getting Started

You will need to clone the repo to your local drive by going to this url: https://github.com/jantmitch/bamazon-cli-app

# Prerequisites

There are a few things you will need to get the application running. You will need to install a few npm packages to run the commands. When you have the repo cloned to your local drive, and you are in the git directory, these are the packages you will need to install:

* npm install inquirer
* npm install mysql


# Running Application Test
